 Write a program in C to read 10 numbers from the keyboard and find their sum and average

#include<stdio.h>
int main () {
   int i,n ,s=0 ;
   
   for(i=1;i<=10;i++) {
       printf("the number is ");
       scanf("%d",&n);
       s =s+i;
   }
       float average =(float) s/10;
       printf("the sum of number is %d",s);
       printf("the average of number is %f",average);
   
   
}
